                    You play many roles in my life, but most importantly, you are my sister. I love that the Lord pulled us back together and has blessed us in our friendship and in all that we are doing. It is an honor to be your friend. It is an honor to know you. It is an honor to love you.
                </p>

                <p class="letter-text">
                    Today is a very important and special day because it is the day the Lord decided to produce a daughter in the earth, one who would reflect His nature and resolve many problems in this world.
                </p>

                <p class="letter-text">
                    "You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you."
                </p>

                    I don't know when you will receive your gift, but I do want to send you the description. This idea came to me months ago, and I wrote it down as what I wanted to give you for your birthday. The scenery is placed there so that you never forget the position and posture you are to remain in as you receive more from the Father.
                </p>

                <p class="letter-text">
                    This posture points you back to Psalm 24, a blueprint for how you will always walk into a place of ascension. Never forget that you belong to the Lord your God. You may be a business coach here, but you are also Heaven's business coach. Heaven agrees with you and waits for your continued acceptance and unfolding revelation of Christ so you can fulfill His work in the earth. Heaven agrees because they recognize and witness that you are a son in the earth!

                <p class="letter-text">
                    I pray that your birthday is filled with the desires God has placed inside your heart and overflowing with milk and honey.
                </p>

                <p class="letter-text">
                    I love you, my sister.

                    Have a beautiful birthday.
